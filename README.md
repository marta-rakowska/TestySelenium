- 'headless': Boolean value indicating whether to run the tests in headless mode.

## Running Tests

To run tests, you can use the pytest framework. For example, to run all tests, navigate to the project root directory and run:
'pytest'.

## Test Cases

The 'test_order_processing.py' module contains test cases for the order processing functionality of the web application FT TEST SHOP.

## Test Reports and Screenshots

When a test fails, a screenshot of the web page at the time of failure is captured and saved in the screenshots directory.

If a report is generated, the screenshot is then attached to the test report. This provides visual information about the state of the application at the time of failure.

The 'conftest.py' file contains the necessary hooks and logic to capture and attach the screenshots to the test reports.

To create a test report, you can run the following command:
'pytest --html=report.html'.
